    "When first created, all of the network's weights are set randomly -- the network doesn't \"know\" anything yet. So we need to train a neural network; this is how neural networks learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all machine learning tasks, we begin with a set of training data. Each example in the training data consists of some features (the inputs) together with an expected target (the output). Training the network means adjusting its weights in such a way that it can transform the features into the target. In the 80 Cereals dataset, for instance, we want a network that can take each cereal's 'sugar', 'fiber', and 'protein' content and produce a prediction for that cereal's 'calories'. If we can successfully train a network to do that, its weights must represent in some way the relationship between those features and that target as expressed in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the training data, we need two more things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **loss function** that measures how good the network's predictions are.\n",
    "- An **optimizer** that can tell the network how to change its weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtually all of the optimization algorithms used in deep learning belong to a family called stochastic gradient descent. They are iterative algorithms that train a network in steps. One step of training goes like this:\n",
    "1. Sample some training data and run it through the network to make predictions.\n",
    "2. Measure the loss between the predictions and the true values.\n",
    "3. Finally, adjust the weights in a direction that makes the loss smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then just do this over and over until the loss is as small as you like (or until it won't decrease any further.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each iteration's sample of training data is called a **minibatch** (or often just \"batch\"), while a complete round of the training data is called an **epoch**. The number of epochs you train for is how many times the network will see each training example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "A smaller **learning rate** means the network needs to see more minibatches before its weights converge to their best values. The learning rate and the size of the minibatches are the two parameters that have the largest effect on how the SGD training proceeds. Their interaction is often subtle and the right choice for these parameters isn't always obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, for most work it won't be necessary to do an extensive hyperparameter search to get satisfactory results. Adam is an SGD algorithm that has an adaptive learning rate that makes it suitable for most problems without any parameter tuning (it is \"self tuning\", in a sense). Adam is a great general-purpose optimizer."
